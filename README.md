# Authentication in Ember

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/ember-resources](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ember-resources)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/ember-resources-one-to-many](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ember-resources-one-to-many)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Implement token authentication in an Ember application.
-   Enforce authentication in protected routes.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`.
1.  Follow the instructions to setup the [API]().
1.  Start the font-end server with `ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000`.

## Ember Services

## Demo: Write a Demo

Demos are demonstrations, and developers should give their full attention to
them. It's a great time for them to take notes about important concepts before
applying them in an exercise.

Demos correspond to the "I do" portion of scaffolding from consultant trainging.

## Exercise: Write an Exercise

During exercises, developers should apply concepts covered in the previous demo.
This is their first chance to generalize concepts introduced. Exercises should
be very focused, and flow natural into a lab.

Exercises correspond to the "We do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
trainging.

## Lab: Write a Lab

During labs, developers get to demonstrate their understanding of concepts from
demos and applied knowledge from exercises. Labs are an opportunity for
developers to build confidence, and also serve as a diagnostic tool for
consultants to evaluate developer understanding.

Labs should be timed explicitly using a timer. When estimating the time it will
take to complete a lab, it is better to overestimate. During labs, consultants
should circle the room and interact with developers, noting patterns and
prompting with hints on how to complete the lab. If developers end early, a
consultant may stop the lab timer. If developers do not finish in time, a
consultant may give more time at her discretion based on current talk pace, the
current estimate for the talk, and the importance of completing the lab while
consultant support is available.

Labs correspond to the "You do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
trainging.
